# Hello, World.

Testing these new waters with hopes that I can finally kick this shit off. Let's try some
basics:

```python
import sys

def this_shit_is_poppin():
    return True
```

Next steps:

1. Test out the server.
2. Start drafting first _actual_ draft.
3. Decide where hosting this from: github.io or Arvixe

Laters.
